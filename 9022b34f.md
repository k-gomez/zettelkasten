# Focused and researchable

Based on [Scribbr](https://www.scribbr.com/research-process/research-questions/).


| Criteria | Explanation |
| -------- | ----------- |
| Focuses on a single topic and problem | Your central research question should follow from your research problem to keep your work focused. If you have multiple questions, they should all clearly relate to this central aim. |
| Answerable using primary or secondary data | You must be able to find an answer by collecting quantitative and/or qualitative data, or by reading scholarly sources on the topic to develop an argument. If such data is impossible to access, you will have to rethink your question and ask something more concrete. |
| Does not ask for a subjective value judgement | Avoid subjective words like good, bad, better and worse, as these do not give clear criteria for answering the question. If your question is evaluating something, use terms with more measurable definitions. <br> - Is X or Y a better policy? <br> - How effective are X and Y policies at reducing rates of Z? |
