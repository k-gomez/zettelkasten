# Feasible and specific

Based on [Scribbr](https://www.scribbr.com/research-process/research-questions/).

| Criteria | Explanation |
| -------- | ----------- |
| Answerable within practical constraints | Make sure you have enough time and resources to do the research required to answer the question. If you think you might struggle to gain access to enough data, consider narrowing down the question to be more specific. |
| Uses specific, well-defined concepts | All the terms you use in the research question should have clear meanings. Avoid vague language and broad ideas, and be clear about what, who, where and when your question addresses. <br> - What effect does social media have on peopleâ€™s minds? <br> - What effect does daily use of Twitter have on the attention span of under-16s? |
| Does not ask for a conclusive solution, policy, or course of action | Research is about informing, not instructing. Even if your project is focused on a practical problem, it should aim to improve understanding and suggest possibilities rather than asking for a ready-made solution. <br> - What should the government do about low voter turnout? <br> - What are the most effective communication strategies for increasing voter turnout among under-30s? |
