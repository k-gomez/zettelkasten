# Relevant and original

Based on [Scribbr](https://www.scribbr.com/research-process/research-questions/).

| Criteria | Explanation |
| -------- | ----------- |
| Addresses a problem relevant to your field or discipline | The research question should be developed based on initial reading around your topic, and it should focus on addressing a problem or gap in the existing knowledge. |
| Contributes to a topical social or academic debate | The question should aim to contribute to an existing debate — ideally one that is current in your field or in society at large. It should produce knowledge that future researchers or practitioners can build on. |
| Has not already been answered | You don’t have to ask something groundbreaking that nobody has ever thought of before, but the question should have some aspect of originality (for example, by focusing on a specific location or taking a new angle on a long-running debate). |
