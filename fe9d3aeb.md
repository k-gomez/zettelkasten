# Successors of knowledge graphs and data combination

Different frameworks and solutions already work with knowledge graphs and linking of data. Most prominent examples are from chemical, biomedical or bioinformatical research. Examples are:
- The Unified Medical Language System
- The European Molecular Bioloy Laboratory
- The European Bioinfomatics Institute
- The Universal Protein Resource

Those examples allow researches in those areas to have a common vocabulary. In [[5bff0e90]], this is relevant for my [[4d25aab0]].
