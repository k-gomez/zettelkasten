# Functional and inverse functional (together)

Used by [[ac99d6d4]] in their [[83a39c63]]

If a property has multiple potential instances to another instance, but each pair is unique, than the relationship is [[b29036bf]] and [[288c8a65]]. 

## Example 

For example: a pizza dough isBaseOf a margherita pizza. A pizza dough is also the base of a salami pizza.  However, both pairs are unique.

Components will not be [[288c8a65]] and [[b29036bf]] because we have a lot of shared components across vehicle models and manufacturers.

- `exportsFile` or `exportsReport` (each file would be unique)
