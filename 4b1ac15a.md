# When is a cluster and environment or perspective?

[[7eeb8589]] and [[d4340028]] can be detected through clusters. One potential solution is when I use [[085951b3]] to visually show the clusters.

However, how do you know if a visually shown cluster is a environment or a perspective? Maybe, perspective focus on [[4748cbe0]] rather than the vehicle state. Hence, if vehicle data is relating to the state of the car, it could be an environment-cluster.

For example: If different axioms describe that the vehicle speed is 0 for a certain time and the GPS position was not update for a certain time, than you could related this to a specific environment. Here, a crash or the forensics labor would be a potential environment.
