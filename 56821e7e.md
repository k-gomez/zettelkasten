# Domains (intersection)

Used by [[ac99d6d4]] in their [[83a39c63]]

The selected property has each [class expression](https://protegeproject.github.io/protege/class-expression-syntax) listed in this section in its domain. If a given property has a given class in its domain this means that any individual that has a value for the property (i.e. is the subject of a relation along the property), will be inferred to be an instance of that domain class.

Heavily related to [[320aaea9]]
[[0894dea3]]

## Example

If `Tesla hasModel Model-3` and Manufacturer is listed in the domain of `hasModel`, then Tesla will be inferred to be an instance of Manufacturer. Note that domain does not mean that “the class Manufacturer has `hasModel`as a property”.
