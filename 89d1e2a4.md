# Difference between CASE and my work

[[e92797f6]] mainly focuses on providing a common vocabulary and data format to hold investigation details / results. It is **not** used to store knowledge. Up to now, there are not that much examples and a lack of implementation (examples) for the ontology. Sadly, this is my main use-case.

My work aims to enable reuse of analysis results. Especially in the domain of [[5bff0e90]], a lot of SW / HW reuse is performed. Hence, knowledge is valuable for future investigations.
