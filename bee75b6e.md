# Ontology

Structure of connections and characteristics for a specific system that exists in real-world. Common vocabulary to enable sharing of information within a domain.

OWL2: Based on the description logic SROIQ(D) --> [[db41d1ab]]#

Classes: Characteristics that represent information from the real-world. Classes are strongly connected to taxonomies

Instances: Sub-items (e.g. subclass) of a class. It can be a (sub)class (contains one or more instances or individuals) or an individual (is unique under all circumstances). Instances must be related to their classes

Affiliations: Connections between instances. E.g. is an

Knowledge base: Combination of ontology and instances

Aximos: Knowledge about a specific domain. E.g. every vehicle model has a manufacturer

Reasoning: Determine classification (determine most specific sub- and super-classes for all named classes), subsumption (find sub-, super-, or equivalent classes), consistency (determine differences in knowledge base), and instantiation (determine instances of classes)
