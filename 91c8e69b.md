# Irreflexive

Used by [[ac99d6d4]] in their [[83a39c63]]

Asserting that a property is irreflexive means that an individual cannot be related to itself via that property.

Inverse of [[8cd765c6]]

## Example 

"*The SROIQ paper actually mentions that the main use cases for reflexive and irreflexive properties are limited and only make sense when used along with cardinality restrictions. I.e. if you define PopularPerson as someone with at least 2 friends, and hasFriend is reflexive, then by asserting an individual has 1 known friend will result in that individual being classified as a PopularPerson because the individual is already assumed to be its own friend.*" [Due to Stackoverflow, this should be from this paper.
