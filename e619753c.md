# Integrity

Collected memory regions are not modified after the acquisition timestamp t. The timestamp t should be as early as possible in the investigation, but the acquisition tool must be loaded into memory before. So the timestamp t should be right before the acquisition tool is loaded into memory to not see artifacts of the acquisition tool itself. Integrity is how stable values in memory regions remain in the course of imaging operations. Furthermore, the impact on the RAM of the targeted device should be as low as possible. [Voemel2012]

Integrity is not given if the memory regions change between the start and end of the acquisition.

[Ottmann2022] call the definition from [Voemel2012] *restrictive integrity*. However, with this definition, values that are restored before the memory region is added to the snapshot will be lost. The value will be the same as before. Therefore, [Ottmann2022] propose a new definition: *permissive integrity*. It allows to change values during acquisition (i.e. between the start and end of the acquisition), if the value is the same as before. So no value-changes during acquisition are allowed with the new definition.

Snapshots that satisfy integrity do satisfy [[59e6072a]] and [[e44f22c1]]. Hence, this characteristic is the *strongest* of all. [Ottmann2022]
