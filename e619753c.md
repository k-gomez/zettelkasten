# Integrity

Collected memory regions are not modified after the acquisition timestamp t. The timestamp t should be as early as possible in the investigation, but the acquisition tool must be loaded into memory before. So the timestamp t should be right before the acquisition tool is loaded into memory to not see artifacts of the acquisition tool itself. Integrity is how stable values in memory regions remain in the course of imaging operations. Furthermore, the impact on the RAM of the targeted device should be as low as possible.
