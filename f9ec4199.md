# Environment filters axioms

[[7eeb8589]] is filtering a fixed set of axioms.

For example: If we have a fixed set of axioms for a vehicle (stuff that describes the vehicle) and we change the environment, we will reduce the number of axioms for a certain time. Sometimes we get more axioms (e.g. if we move the [[5e18d8ac]] to a forensics labor). However, here we have more analysis and extraction capabilities. Hence, we get more axioms for an investigation.
