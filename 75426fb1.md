## Data interpretation

- Components are seldom standardized [Altschaffel2017SurveyAutFor][Altschaffel2020Phd]
    - Proprietary protocols (custom structure) [me]
    - Manufacturer specific identifiers (e. g. UDS) [me][Altschaffel2020Phd]
    - Manufacturer specific data identifiers [me][Altschaffel2020Phd]
    - Different ECU topologies [gomez2019master][Altschaffel2020Phd]
    - High diversity [Altschaffel2020Phd]
- Future hypervisor support [gomez2019master]
- Complexity problem [Reghavan2013DigForRes]
- Unified time-lining problem [Reghavan2013DigForRes]
- What information each module stores [Jacobs2017VWInfotainment]
- What SW tools can be used to interpret acquired data correctly [Jacobs2017VWInfotainment][Altschaffel2020Phd]
- Identification of data types (such as personal data [Jacobs2017VWInfotainment])
- Closed source tools [LeKhac2020VehForChall]
- Any message on the CAN bus can originate from any attached device (no backtracking) [Altschaffel2017SurveyAutFor]
- There are a lot of *individual* forensic investigations in ADF. There are not profiles like in [[0dc8d333]] for automotive systems / components

## Data collection

- Where are the different data types located at? [Jacobs2017VWInfotainment] → which components are relevant?
- Accessibility of the components [gomez2019master][Altschaffel2017SurveyAutFor][Altschaffel2020Phd]
- Complexity problem [Reghavan2013DigForRes]
- Volatile data [Jacobs2017VWInfotainment]
- Closed source tools [LeKhac2020VehForChall]
- Fulfil safety requirement in live forensics [gomez2019master]
- Limited processing power for in-vehicle collection [gomez2019master][Altschaffel2020Phd]
- Low bandwidth [Altschaffel2020Phd]
- Low storage capacity [Altschaffel2017SurveyAutFor][Altschaffel2020Phd]
- Reduced availability of Data Types [Altschaffel2020Phd]
- ECUs are usually not shut down [Altschaffel2020Phd]
- Established and simple network hierarchies [Altschaffel2020Phd]
- Easy physical access to CAN bus [Altschaffel2020Phd]

## Data integrity

- Effects on data due to power loss? [Jacobs2017VWInfotainment]
- Lack tools that do not affect integrity [Jacobs2017VWInfotainment]
- Damaged components
- Data integrity given if the tools are closed source [LeKhac2020VehForChall]?
- Memory wear reduces reliance on Non-volatile Memory [Altschaffel2020Phd]
- Doubtful Origin Authenticity in CAN networks [Altschaffel2020Phd]

## Data correlation

- Proprietary protocols and therefore data
- Manual correlation, if the data is from different sources
- Consistency and correlation [Reghavan2013DigForRes]
- Complexity problem [Reghavan2013DigForRes]
- Quantity and volume problem [Reghavan2013DigForRes]
- Unified time-lining problem [Reghavan2013DigForRes]
- Data from supporting infrastructure [Jacobs2017VWInfotainment]
- Cross-domain and cross-component effects on evidence unknown
- Dominance of functional data in Communication in Automotive IT [Altschaffel2020Phd]
- There are a lot of *individual* forensic investigations in ADF. There are not profiles like in [[0dc8d333]] for automotive systems / components

## Data privacy and security

- Privacy of the collected data [Mansor2017Phd] → who owns the data?
- Protection of the data [Mansor2017Phd]
- High component lifetime [Altschaffel2020Phd]
