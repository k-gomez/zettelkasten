# Uniqueness in ADF
[[5bff0e90]]#

- Vehicles are used by **multiple users** (family, car-sharing, car rental)
- Vehicles are **massively networked** (within the inside and to the outside)
    - The impact from the outside is high (OEM backend information, service provider data)
- **Diversity** in vehicles
    - There is a massive mixture of technologies
    - Mixtures of data types
- Vehicles are **cyber physical systems**
    - Create models for the physical systems and match them on the data
- Vehicles are **self-sufficient**
    - The overall vehicle system (AI) with self-driving features
    - Individual components are able to reset themselves
- **~~Lack of tools~~**
- Different control units have **dependencies** with other control units -> they only function within the car or in a HIL
- **~~Legal questions** are often of interest:~~
    - ~~Personal negligence?~~
    - ~~Manipulated vehicle?~~
- Focus on **non-functional requirements**
    - Lots of functional data
- Errors can lead to **safety impact**
- **Hard accessibility** of
    - Components
    - Cars
- There is **no abstraction** in vehicles
    - Definition of *abstraction*: â€¦
    - Vehicles are very **flat** and **hierarchical**
    - AUTOSAR is somewhat an abstraction. However, not on the same level as with operating systems
    - There are different abstraction levels within vehicles (Linux, RTOS, ...)
