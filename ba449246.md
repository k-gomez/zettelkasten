# Tips for data-analysis

From "Factfullness" (Hans Rosling):

- Is there really a gap? [[9804f7f0]]
- When something develops in a certain way it does not necessarily have to continue that way. Graphs can change over time
- Put things in relation 
- Question categories that are defined
- Even small changes can matter over time 
- There is not need for urgency. Small steps matter
