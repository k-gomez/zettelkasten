# Normalization

Especially in [[5bff0e90]], there are a lot of proprietary data formats. Hence, normalization of data is very important.

The [forensics artifacts](https://github.com/ForensicArtifacts/artifacts) repository can help here.

## Forensic artifacts vs. Ontologies

- Forensic artifacts are easy to use. Ontologies are more complicated
- Ontologies introduce reasoners. Forensic artifacts provide syntax checks
- Forensic artifacts are used to normalize data. Ontologies to describe knowledge

Hence, ontologies are more useful in my case. Reasoners are a big plus. Further, normalization is one point I address, but to hold knowledge is even more important
