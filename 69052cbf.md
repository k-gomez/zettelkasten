# CASE focuses on the investigation

[[e92797f6]] describes not only data, it especially highlights **all** process steps from the start of an investigation to a resulting artifact (e.g. file).

*Relationship* objects highlight the connection between objects. Special keywords are "contained-within", "decrypted-from", ... .

Path-relations are realized using the "PathRelation" property bundle.
