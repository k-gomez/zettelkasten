# Rubber band consistency check

Compress a (process) event diagram until the cut is fully vertically aligned. If the message flow does not flow backwards, the event diagram is consistent. The cut is done through a set of events that occur after each other. A cut sets an area "before" the snapshot and "after" the snapshot. [Mattern1989]

This is relevant if we create timelines of snapshot from [[5bff0e90]] investigations.
