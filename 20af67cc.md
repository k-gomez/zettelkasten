# Survivorship bias

Focus on survivors in evaluating an outcome and event.

The example is from the U.S. military where they hardened the spots on a plane that got hit. The better solution was to harden everything that was not hit since those planes didn't got back.

The same could be relevant in [[db8ec17f]] were we want to focus on data that is not there.

In [[5bff0e90]] we have a lot of different [[4748cbe0]] including [[676aee4d]] and [[23e636f1]]. Missing events could therefore also be intersting.

Maybe there is some related work for this?
