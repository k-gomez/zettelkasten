# Instantaneous consistency

''*A snapshot s satisfies instantaneous consistency if all memory regions in s were acquired at the same point in time.*'' [Ottmann2022]

This is a new definition of consistency that is more applicable to real-world applications. The original definition comes from [Voemel2012]

This usually required freezing memory [Ottmann2022]. This is not possible in all investigations. Also in [[5bff0e90]].
