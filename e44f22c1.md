# Correctness

Only store "true" / "actual" values in snapshots. Hence, information that was actually stored in memory when the snapshot was taken. Software-based acquisitions rely on potential compromised host-OS. The degree of correctness the percentage of memory cells that have been acquired correctly. [Voemel2012]
