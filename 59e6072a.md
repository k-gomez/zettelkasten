# Atomic

There should be no signs of concurrent system activity. A snapshot is atomic if the cut is consistent. For example, memory is changed after it was read by the acquisition tool. We need to "lock" the system to achieve atomicity. An working example are "pauses" of virtual machines. [Voemel2012Correctness]
