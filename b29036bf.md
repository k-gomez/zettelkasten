# Functional

Used by [[ac99d6d4]] in their [[83a39c63]]

For any given individual, the property can have at most one value. In other words, there can be at most one **out going** relationship along the property for that individual. A functional property is a property that can have only one (unique) value y for each instance x, i.e. there **cannot** be two distinct values y1 and y2 such that the pairs (x,y1) and (x,y2) are both instances of this property.

Functional is relevant if we have multiple outgoing individuals that are *the same* but are named differently.

Properties can also be functional and [[288c8a65]]. See here: [[152f38c7]]

## Example

If we assume that all components introduce only one data-storage system, every individual can be linked by the `hasStorageSystem` property to at most one other individual. Note that this statement does not require every individual to have a storage system.

- `Infotainment currentUser XL123` and `Infotainment currentUser LM332`: `XL123` and `LM332` are the same. Could be if two different services have different naming of users
- Same with `hasSerialNumber`
