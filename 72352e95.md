# RDF

RDF is a standard model for data interchange on the Web. RDF has features that facilitate data merging even if the underlying schemas differ, and it specifically supports the evolution of schemas over time without requiring all the data consumers to be changed. [W3](https://www.w3.org/RDF/)

Works with subject, predicate, and object.
