# Modelling

Graph calculus to highlight relationships between objects. Similar as [[bee75b6e]] are using connections

Directed graph is with arrows. 
```
G = (V, E)

V = {a, b, c}
E = {(a, b), (a, c), (a, c), (c, b)}
```

Undirected graph is without arrows.
```
G = (V, E)

V = {a, b, c}
E = {{a, b}, {a, c}, {b,c}}
```

Degree of a graph is input-degree + output-degree. Higher degree is higher forensic relevance ([[5bff0e90]])?
