# Modelling

Graph calculus to highlight relationships between objects.

Directed graph is with arrows. 
```
G = (V, E)

V = {a, b, c}
E = {(a, b), (a, c), (a, c), (c, b)}
```

Undirected graph is without arrows.
```
G = (V, E)

V = {a, b, c}
E = {{a, b}, {a, c}, {b,c}}
```

Degree of a graph is input-degree + output-degree. Higher degree is higher forensic relevance ([[5bff0e90]])?

## Model learning

Models need to be updated. This is where model learning comes into play. For example: 

1. Build model
2. System interacts with model
3. We have findings (pros and contra)
4. Refine and update the model

## Model checking 

Compare behavior of programs with the specification.
