# Data sources in ADF
[[5bff0e90]]#

## Definition

A *data source* in the context of automotive digital forensics is the origin of information relevant for digital forensic investigations.Â  A data source is a defined structure of information resulting from one or multiple tools. The representation can also be standardized in a predefined data format.
