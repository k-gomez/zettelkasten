Tools we learned:

- `... and ... but ... therefore` to structure our arguments
- Breaks are key! Breath between sentences and say `and break`
- Fake it until you make it. E.g. "*I am going to be relaxed!*"
- Tell yourself positive statements. E.g. "*I am relaxed! I am doing my PhD!*"
- 5-sentence-structure
  1. Initial sentence 
  2. What is state-of-the-art?
  3. What should be the state-of-the-art?
  4. How do we achieve the goal?
  5. My conclusion

Critical questions:

- Answer with `Yes, exactly. And ...`
- Determine your *killer questions*
- Say what you see / feel. E.g. "*I see that you are angry. I see that you do not like my argument.*"
