# Inverse Functional
Parent: [[83a39c63]]

The inverse property of the selected property (whether it is explicitly declared or not) is Functional. In other words, there can be at most one **incoming** relationship along the property for that individual. In the language of the databases world, "Inverse Functional Property" means "This property is a Unique.". 

Inverse functional is relevant if we have multiple incoming individuals that are *the same* but are named differently.

## Examples

If we state that P is an *owl:InverseFunctionalProperty*, then this asserts that a value y can only be the value of P for a single instance x, i.e. there **cannot** be two distinct instances x1 and x2 such that both pairs (x1,y) and (x2,y) are instances of P.
