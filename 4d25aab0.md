# Data in a knowledge-base

Data in a knowledge-base might be limited. However, in the concept phase (i.e. design) there should be as much information as possible in the knowledge-base. During implementation this can change.

For example: If your knowledge-base contains *all* information you collected during forensic investigations, queries could take very long. This is not very good. Hence, data / information in the knowledge-base must be reduced.
