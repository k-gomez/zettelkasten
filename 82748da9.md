# Class properties
Parent: [[ac99d6d4]]

## Equivalent To

Contains [class-expressions](https://protegeproject.github.io/protege/class-expression-syntax) (e.g. some, value, only, min, max, ...) that are equal to the current selected class.

## Subclass Of

Each row is a superclass of the current selected class

## Instances

Each row specifies an individual that has the current selected class as its type in a class assertion axiom.

## Disjoint With

Each row specifies a list of [class-expressions](https://protegeproject.github.io/protege/class-expression-syntax) (e.g. some, value, only, min, max, ...) that this class is disjoint with. 

## Target for Key

For a given individual the particular values of these properties taken together imply distinctness. For example, a key consisting of hasSurname and hasDateOfBirth could be used (in a limited setting) to imply distinctness of the individuals in the class Person.

## Disjoint Union Of

Specifies that this class is the main class in a `DisjointUnion` class axiom.

## SubClass Of (Anonymous Ancestor)

Protégé examines ancestors of the selected class and accumulates all of their superclasses which are then displayed in this section.
