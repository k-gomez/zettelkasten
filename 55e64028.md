# Quasi-instantaneous consistency

''*A snapshot s satisfies quasi-instantaneous consistency if the values in the snapshot could have also been acquired with an instantaneous snapshot s'.*'' [Ottmann2022]

This is a new definition of consistency that is more applicable to real-world applications. The original definition comes from [Voemel2012]
