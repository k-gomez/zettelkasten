# Perspective extend the number of axioms

If we change the [[d4340028]], we will get more axioms with further analysis.

We start with the perspective *component*. We are able to describe general information about the component such as interfaces, hardware component, and more. If we now change the perspective to *chip on the component*, we will additional axioms. Now we are able to perform additonal analyses and gain deeper understanding about the chip and therefore about the component.
