# Complex and arguable

Based on [Scribbr](https://www.scribbr.com/research-process/research-questions/).

| Criteria | Explanation |
| -------- | ----------- |
| Cannot be answered with yes or no | Closed yes/no questions are too simple to work as good research questions — they don’t provide enough scope for investigation and discussion. <br> - Has there been an increase in homelessness in the UK in the past ten years? <br> - How have economic and political factors affected patterns of homelessness in the UK over the past ten years? |
| Cannot be answered with easily found facts and figures | If you can answer the question through a Google search or by reading a single book or article, it is probably not complex enough. A good research question requires original data, synthesis of multiple sources, interpretation and/or argument to provide an answer.| 
| Provides scope for debate and deliberation | The answer to the question should not just be a simple statement of fact: there needs to be space for you to discuss and interpret what you found. This is especially important in an essay or research paper, where the answer to your question often takes the form of an argumentative thesis statement. |
