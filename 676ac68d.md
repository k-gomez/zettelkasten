# Object and environment

The environment can change the object. For example, if a vehicle is on the road, the components behave different compared to a vehicle on a test-bank.

[[4748cbe0]] is changed in this case. On the road, GSP information is frequently changing, while on the test-bank it is not. 

On the other hand, some features like ECU resets (through UDS messages) are not possible while the vehicle is driving.

This is because the vehicle ecosystem is a [[64f1cb71]] and interacts with the environment through actuators.
