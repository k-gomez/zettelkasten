# Ranges (intersection)
Parent: [[83a39c63]]

The selected property has each [class expression](https://protegeproject.github.io/protege/class-expression-syntax) listed in this section in its range. If a given property has a given class in its range this means that any individual that is the value for the property (i.e. is the object of a relation along the property), will be inferred to be an instance of that range class.

## Example

If `Tesla hasModel Model-3` and Manufacturer is listed in the range of `hasModel`, then Tesla will be inferred to be an instance of Manufacturer. Note that range does not mean that, “the class Manufacturer is a value for the `hasModel` property”.
