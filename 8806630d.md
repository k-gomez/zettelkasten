# Modern vehicles have more than 1000 ways of compromise

Modern vehicles have about 100 million lines of code with at least one bug per 1000 lines [Standberg2022]. Hence, there are at least 100000 bugs in modern vehicles. Based on [Llanso2018], at least 1% of software vulnerabilities are exploitable. As a result, modern vehicles have more than 1000 ways of compromise.
