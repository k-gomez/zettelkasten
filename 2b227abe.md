# Forensic artifacts vs. ontologies

Relevant in [[c2547eb6]] of data

- Forensic artifacts are easy to use. Ontologies are more complicated
- Ontologies introduce reasoners. Forensic artifacts provide syntax checks
- Forensic artifacts are used to normalize data. Ontologies to describe knowledge

Hence, ontologies are more useful in my case. Reasoners are a big plus. Further, normalization is one point I address, but to hold knowledge is even more important
