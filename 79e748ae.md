# Elements in a set are not mandatory for a model

In a set, elements are just *examples*. They are not mandatory for the model.

## Example

If we have a model `P` of playing cards. Each card in the model (set) is not relevant for `P`. Rather the [[18afd6eb]] and are mandatory for each card.

Let's say, we have a mode `P1` where all the hearths are missing. We can formally describe the set as follows:

```
P1 = { (c1), (c2), ..., (cn)}, where c is a card that is not a hearth.
```
